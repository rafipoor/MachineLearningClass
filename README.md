# MachineLearningClass
I will share the scripts for my machine learning classes in this repository. The scripts are written by myself. I tried it to be illustatory and easy to follow. My aim was to show how the baseic algorithms of machine learning and pattern recognition systems are working. For sure, there are many parts that could be implemented more efficient. Hence, the scripts may not be good for real applications, unless you change some parts and specilize it.
Please let me know your feedbacks and comments on how can I improve the collection or what necessary parts I have missed.
